# Project Statement:
Online Dentition Booking Platform

# Project Description:

According to Dental Economics, 97 percent of all dental clients choose to get information from a dentist’s website instead of calling the dentist’s office. Gone are the days of hard copies. Instead, we have entered a fully digital world. Dental website designs and online resources are the most popular way for customers to find a firm. Similarly, online presence is the most common way for firms to attract customers. This transition to becoming a part of the internet world is essential for the dental industry. Dentist sites now enable clients to book appointments online or discover more about the services with a single click. Therefore, don’t just take our word for it!
